# SQL COVID-19 QUERIES PROJECT

COVID-19 data is taken to perform SQL queries to showcase the use and implementation of joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate functions, creating views, converting data types and the use of different subquery types. 

To view the queries created explore the script file included in this repository.

The data: Coronavirus (COVID-19)

Two tables were used for this project, the covid_deaths table with 25 columns (location, date, new_deaths,...) and the covid_vaccinations table with 38 columns (location, date, new_vaccinations,...). each table contains 95963 records. The tables include all countries and daily data as time series from 2/24/2020 to 7/6/2021. The queries on this project were used to create visualizations with Tableau.
