# SQL COVID-19 QUERIES 

COVID-19 data is taken to perform 25 SQL queries showcasing the implementation of joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate functions, creating views, converting data types and the use of different subquery types.

Two tables were used for this project, the covid_deaths table with 25 columns (location, date, new_deaths,...) and the covid_vaccinations table with 38 columns (location, date, new_vaccinations,...). each table contains 95963 records. The tables include all countries and daily data as time series from 2/24/2020 to 7/6/2021. The queries on this project were used to create visualizations with Tableau.
